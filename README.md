# Machine Learning Example with Iris Dataset
This is a simple machine learning example using Python and scikit-learn library. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to load the famous iris dataset, split it into training and testing sets, create a k-NN classifier with k=3, fit the classifier to the training data, make predictions on the testing data, and print the accuracy score.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which is a classic dataset for classification. It contains 150 instances with 4 features and 3 classes. The classes are Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolour, and Iris-Virginica.

# Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 and scikit-learn library installed. You can install scikit-learn using pip:
```
pip install scikit-learn
```

# Usage
To run the project, simply run the following command:
```
python main.py
```
The output should show the accuracy score of the k-NN classifier.
